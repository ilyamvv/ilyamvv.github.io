            The information contained on this website (including, but not limited to: the reviews, lists, order of appearance, placements, positions, evaluations, comparisons, and links) are paid-for promotional and sponsored advertising content. This website is compensated by the companies advertised on this website when a user clinks on the links and/or makes a purchase from an advertising partner (listed here).<br><br>

            Free Products<br>
            For some reviews we received a free sample product to aid in the writing of the review.
            <br><br>
            Please note that although we may receive a product, that does not necessarily mean we will write a review or that we will write a favorable review. We do try to work with brands and products that are the best in their respective category, which helps us to not have to write overly negative reviews.
            <br><br>
            Our Partners<br><br>
            A majority of the links to products on our site are “affiliate links,” meaning that purchases made after those links are clicked will provide us with a commission, which is how we are able to continue writing reviews.
            <br><br>
            Not every company listed on our site will provide a commission. That said, the companies that provide us a commission and are therefore our advertising partners are (in no particular order):<br>
