            This privacy policy (“Policy”) describes how the personally identifiable information (“Personal
            Information”) you may provide on the consumerrating.org website (“Website” or “Service”) and any of its
            related products and services (collectively, “Services”) is collected, protected and used. It also describes
            the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you can access and
            update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”)
            and Mattress4You (“Mattress4You”, “we”, “us” or “our”). By accessing and using the Website and
            Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Policy.
            This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals
            that we do not employ or manage.<br><br>

         <p class="info__text">
            Collection of information<br>
            Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise the no logs policy. We may process only
            minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and Services.
            Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
            statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical
            information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.
            <br><br>
            Use and processing of collected information<br>
            In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to
            collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may
            not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from
            you may be used for the following purposes:
            <br>
            Improve products and services<br><br>
            Send marketing and promotional communications<br>
            Request user feedback<br>
            Improve user experience<br>
            Deliver targeted advertising<br>
            Run and operate the Website and Services<br>
            Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you
            are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or
            more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is
            subject to California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is
            necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv)
            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
            authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by
            us or by a third party.
            <br><br>
            Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
            processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases
            below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and
            in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
            requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
            <br><br>
            Feedback and testimonials<br>
            We may ask you to provide feedback or testimonials related to your experience using our website. Your
            response is optional, and if you do respond we reserve the right to display your response on our website, or
            in any advertising material presented in any medium. In using your feedback and testimonials, we will not
            reveal any of your personal identification information, other than your first name.
            <br><br>
            Disclosure of information<br>
            Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you
            have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work
            with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and
            Services available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These
            service providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform
            services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these
            purposes only with third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by
            our policies with respect to Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they
            need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose
            Personal Information for their own marketing or other purposes.
            <br><br>
            We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such
            as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
            necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond
            to a government request.
            <br><br>
            In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or
            sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account, and Personal Information will likely be among the
            assets transferred.
            <br><br>
            Retention of information<br>
            We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or
            permitted by law. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information
            after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention
            period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure,
            the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the
            retention period.
            <br><br>
            Transfer of information<br>
            Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a
            country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a
            country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law
            or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard
            your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections
            of this Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.
            <br><br>
            The rights of users<br>
            You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
            right to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your
            consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your
            information if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right
            to learn if information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the
            processing and obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the
            accuracy of your information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under
            certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process
            your information for any purpose other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain
            circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to
            receive your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically
            feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
            provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your
            consent, on a contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
            <br><br>
            The right to object to processing<br>
            Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
            vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
            processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. You must
            know that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can
            object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether we are
            processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of
            this document.
            <br><br>

            You have the right to be provided with a copy of the information we have on you in a structured,

            <br><br>
            California privacy rights<br>
            In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal Information
            (as defined in the statute) to obtain products or services for personal, family, or household use are
            entitled to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the Personal Information we
            shared, if any, with other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the
            categories of Personal Information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such
            personal information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in the current year will
            receive information about the prior year). To obtain this information please contact us.
            <br><br>
            How to exercise these rights<br>
            Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to Mattress4You through the contact details
            provided in this document. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such
            requests. Your request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the person
            you are claiming to be or that you are the authorized representative of such person. You must include
            sufficient details to allow us to properly understand the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to
            your request or provide you with Personal Information unless we first verify your identity or authority to
            make such a request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you.
            <br><br>
            Privacy of children<br>
            We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the
            age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. We encourage
            parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
            instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without
            their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal
            Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of
            age to consent to the processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may
            allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).
            <br><br>
            Do Not Track signals<br>
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to
            have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection
            with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from
            consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The
            Website and Services do not track its visitors over time and across third party websites. However, some
            third party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them
            to tailor what they present to you.
            <br><br>
            Advertisements<br>
            We may display online advertisements and we may share aggregated and non-identifying information about our
            customers that we or our advertisers collect through your use of the Website and Services. We do not share
            personally identifiable information about individual customers with advertisers. In some instances, we may
            use this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored advertisements to the intended
            audience.
            <br><br>
            We may also permit certain third party companies to help us tailor advertising that we think may be of
            interest to users and to collect and use other data about user activities on the Website. These companies
            may deliver ads that might place cookies and otherwise track user behavior.
            <br><br>
            Affiliates<br>
            We may engage in affiliate marketing and have affiliate links present on the Website and Services. If you
            click on an affiliate link, a cookie will be placed on your browser to track any sales for purposes of
            commissions.
            <br><br>
            Links to other resources<br>
            The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be
            aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
            encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each
            and every resource that may collect Personal Information.
            <br><br>
            Information security<br>
            We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
            unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
            safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
            Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless
            network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge
            that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the
            security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website
            and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in
            transit by a third party, despite best efforts.
            <br><br>
            Data breach<br>
            In the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or users
            Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity,
            including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably
            appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to
            and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable
            efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as
            a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the
            Website.
            <br><br>
            Cookies<br>
            The Website and Services use “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file
            that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver
            viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
            domain that issued the cookie to you.
            <br><br>
            We may use cookies to collect, store, and track information for statistical purposes to operate the Website
            and Services. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept
            cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to
            decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of the Website and Services.
            <br><br>
            What are cookies?<br>
            Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on your computer or other devices when
            websites are loaded in a browser. They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a
            single visit (through a “session cookie”) or for multiple repeat visits (using a “persistent cookie”).
            <br><br>
            Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they
            expire when you close the web browser.
            <br><br>
            Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our Website and remain on your desktop or

            efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.
            <br><br>
            Cookies may be set by the Website (“first-party cookies”), or by third parties, such as those who serve
            content or provide advertising or analytics services on the Website (“third party cookies”). These third
            parties can recognize you when you visit our website and also when you visit certain other websites.
            <br><br>
            What type of cookies do we use?<br>
            Necessary cookies<br>
            Necessary cookies allow us to offer you the best possible experience when accessing and navigating through
            our Website and using its features. For example, these cookies let us recognize that you have created an

            Advertising cookies<br>
            Advertising cookies allow us and third parties serve relevant ads to you more effectively and help us
            collect aggregated audit data, research, and performance reporting for advertisers. They also enable us to
            understand and improve the delivery of ads to you and know when certain ads have been shown to you.
            <br><br>
            Your web browser may request advertisements directly from ad network servers, these networks can view, edit,
            or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their website.
            <br><br>
            Although we do not use cookies to create a profile of your browsing behavior on third party websites, we do
            use aggregate data from third parties to show you relevant, interest-based advertising. We do not provide
            any personal information that we collect to advertisers. However, if you do not want any information to be
